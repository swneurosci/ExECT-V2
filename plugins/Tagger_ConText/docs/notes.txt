Notes on the GATE ConText PR and application
============================================

The PR was implemented from descriptions of the ConText algorithm on the web
and in the literature, re-using terms and pseudo terms from the GenContext
implementation of ConText.

You can test the application using the gold standard data provided with
GenContext, in tests/rsAnnotations-1-120-random.txt

The output of GenContext for this test set can be found in
docs/GenContext-output.txt

The output for GenContext and GATE combined for comparison can be found in
docs/GATE-and-GenContext-compared.xls

There are a few differences between the values used in the gold standard,
these are obvious. For example, GATE and GenContext use "Hypothetical as a
value for temporality, whereas the gold standard uses "Not particular"

The value "?" in the GATE results columns of
docs/GATE-and-GenContext-compared.xls means that GATE did not detect anything
for this input.In some cases, GATE failed because the condition noted in the
gold standard was longer than the sentence from which it was found. In other
cases of "?", the gazetteer used to simulate conditions for testing failed to
detect the condition.

The differences in results between the GenContext and GATE implementation of
the algorithm are most likely due to (a) differences in lists of e.g. negations, pseudo
experiencers and (b) differences in the quality of the tokenisation.
