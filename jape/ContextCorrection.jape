// If for some reason context is not applied , i.e. future or hypothetical 
// lookup gets recent Temporality, this rule tries to correct it.

// Could be that more needs to be added to the hypothetical triggers (not very many in there from what I can see)
// But this rule looks good at cleaning up a lot of these misses.

//Hypotheitical to lower case to match context
